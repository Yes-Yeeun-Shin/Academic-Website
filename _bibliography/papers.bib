  abstract = {Immersive authoring provides a powerful 3D content creation experience in virtual reality (VR) by freeing users from the tedious loop of desktop editing and VR validation. However, complex control panels required for creative tasks often disrupt immersion with awkward or unstable spatial interactions. To address this, we present Desk Console, an authoring interface that transforms 2D control panels into virtual 3D controls on a physical desk, enabling tangible spatial interaction similar to real-world interactions. Desk Console transforms traditional control panels into 3D representations based on input types and provides passive haptic feedback through the desk‚Äôs physical surface. We demonstrate Desk Console‚Äôs capabilities through an interactive 3D scene design application.},

abstract = {How can we play with space? We present Spatial Chef, a spatial cooking game that focuses on interacting with space itself, shifting away from the conventional object interaction of virtual reality (VR) games. This allows players to generate and transform the virtual environment (VE) around them directly. To capture the ambiguity of space, we created a game interface with full-body movement based on the player‚Äôs perception of spatial interaction. This was evaluated as easy and intuitive, providing clues for the spatial interaction design. Our user study reveals that manipulating virtual space can lead to unique experiences: Being both a player and an absolute and Experiencing realized fantasy. This suggests the potential of interacting with space as an engaging gameplay mechanic. Spatial Chef proposes turning the VE, typically treated as a passive backdrop, into an active medium that responds to the player‚Äôs intentions, creating a fun and novel experience.},

abstract = {Mobile augmented reality (AR) applications have become essential tools for delivering additional information to museum visitors. However, interacting through a mobile screen can potentially distract visitors from the exhibits. We propose WonderScope which is a peripheral system for mobile devices that enables practical near-surface AR interaction. Using a single small RFID tag on the exhibit as the origin, WonderScope can detect the position and orientation of the device on the surface of the exhibit. It performs on various surfaces of different materials based on the result of data fusion from two types of displacement sensors and an accelerometer of an inertial measurement unit (IMU). The mobile application utilizes the data for spatial registration of digital content on the exhibit‚Äôs surface, which make the users feel like seeing-through or magnifying the surface of exhibits.},

abstract = {The 3D pen has become a popular crafting tool where hands-on deformations are largely engaged. However, as malleable states are invisible, users might be burnt, or their fabrication might fail. We designed a thermochromic 3D filament, ChromoFilament, that displays the malleable states in three different colors according to the associated temperatures. From color design workshops, we identified proper stages of malleability and design considerations for color combinations, which are applied to ChromoFilament. Next, we depict a way to fabricate ChromoFilament from customizing thermochromic ink to extruding with the coated pellets. Finally, we illustrate the users‚Äô distinctive behaviors with ChromoFilament to imply the effects of visible malleable states. We believe that our material-perspective approach, design process, and a series of findings could not only inspire supporting creativity through thermoforming but also heat-based processing in 3D printing.},
