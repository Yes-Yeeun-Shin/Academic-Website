    I envision <span class="text-theme-color"> Creativity in Action </span> where immersive creation is driven by senses and natural movement, like <span class="text-light-color"> thinking with hands</span>. For this vision, I explore novel interaction techniques for adaptive XR+AI systems that transform instinctive movement and everyday interactions into expressive workflows at the intersection of technical Human-Computer Interaction, Extended Reality(XR), Tangible Interaction, and Creativity Support.

    Recently, I design multimodal AI interfaces with Gemini LLMs at Samsung Electronics, advancing accessible humanâ€“AI interaction and co-creation through conversational design and reasoning visualization. Previously, I earned my [MS at KAIST, advised by Prof. Woohun Lee](https://www.wonderlab.kaist.ac.kr/){:target="_blank"} and [BS in Materials Science and Engineering at POSTECH](https://mse.postech.ac.kr/main-eng/){:target="_blank"}.
