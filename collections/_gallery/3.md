      **[ Generating material ― Survey ― One way ANOVA ― Bonferroni post hoc test ]**

      I created seven material variants in Unity by adjusting five visual factors *(hue, brightness, glossiness, reflectance, transparency)*. In the survey, participants evaluated four perceived properties *(weight, hardness, temperature, fragility)*.

###### *Independent Project*
After hearing ‘This color looks heavy, and that color looks light,’ I became interested in **how people infer physical properties of objects from visual information**. To investigate this, I conducted a survey on how visual design influences material perception.
