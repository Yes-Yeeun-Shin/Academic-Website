Immersive authoring provides a powerful 3D content creation experience in virtual reality (VR) by freeing users from the tedious loop of desktop editing and VR validation. However, complex control panels required for creative tasks often disrupt immersion with awkward or unstable spatial interactions. 
To address this, we present Desk Console, an authoring interface that transforms 2D control panels into virtual 3D controls on a physical desk, enabling tangible spatial interaction similar to real-world interactions. Desk Console transforms traditional control panels into 3D representations based on input types and provides passive haptic feedback through the desk’s physical surface. We demonstrate Desk Console’s capabilities through an interactive 3D scene design application.
